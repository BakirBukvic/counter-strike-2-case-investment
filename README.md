A simple django project that tracks your cs2 case porfolio investment.

It pulls case prices from the steam marketplace api.

Currently this isn't made to scale. This is made for 1 user that wants to host it on their local machine, to keep personal track of cs2 investemnts.

Can work with normal skins as well
